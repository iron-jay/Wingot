This script will automate the downloading of package from winget, then importing them into MCM for enterprise deployment and monitoring.<br>
It's a simpler method of updating 3rd party apps for your environment instead of manually packaging everything.

Simple edit the variables at the top of the script to make it work for you.

Also has the ability to download content on one machine, and import it into MCM on another, incase your MCM server does not have open internet access.<br>
Lastly, offers the option to put all imported apps in a task sequence.
